Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Overview
Product Name:
AgentCommunicationTool (integrated with OpenAI Agents + Authed)

Objective:
Provide an easy-to-use, plug-and-play solution for OpenAI-based developers to send and receive messages with remote agents via the Authed protocol. The tool must encapsulate all Authed capabilities (secure channel opening, message handling, encryption/signing, registry integration, logging) while requiring minimal configuration from the developer (essentially just specifying the target agent ID and adding the tool to the agent’s tool list).

Success Criteria:

Developer’s perspective: Must require only 2–3 lines of code to set up.
Fully operational: Must correctly handle opening channels, sending messages, receiving responses, and (optionally) closing channels, including any advanced Authed features such as cryptographic signing, encryption, or heartbeat pings.
Reliability & Observability: Must handle errors gracefully, log communications, and provide robust diagnostics for debugging.
2. Background & Rationale
2.1 The Problem
OpenAI Agent developers typically want their agents to communicate with external services or other agents. Implementing a distributed protocol with encryption, authentication, and channel management is non-trivial. Without a simple, standardized tool, developers would have to manage:

WebSocket setup and state management
Authentication with Authed’s registry
Secure key handling
Reconnecting or channel re-opening logic
Sending/receiving messages with a consistent schema
Error handling / Timeouts
2.2 Why This Tool
Authed already provides a robust “ChannelAgent” for WebSocket messaging. However, it is not trivial for an OpenAI Agent developer to plug that into the tool ecosystem – especially if they must do it from scratch. By building a dedicated AgentCommunicationTool that wraps the entire workflow, we enable the developer to simply:

python
Copy
Edit
from openai import Agent
from my_distributed_sdk.tools import AgentCommunicationTool

my_tool = AgentCommunicationTool(target_agent_id="AGENT_B_ID")
agent = Agent(tools=[my_tool])
…and immediately benefit from all Authed features, behind the scenes, with no additional boilerplate.

3. Product Scope & Features
3.1 In-Scope
Tool Creation

A class called AgentCommunicationTool (or similar) that inherits from OpenAI’s base Tool / OpenAITool structure.
Encapsulation of ChannelAgent usage for all messaging tasks.
Simple Initialization

Accepts minimal parameters (e.g., target_agent_id, optional registry_url, optional agent_credentials).
Automatically configures or retrieves the local agent’s credentials, keys, or secrets (or at least provides a fallback for environment-based config).
Message Sending

Must accept a text message (and potentially other fields if necessary) and send it to the target agent.
Supports synchronous (_run) and asynchronous (_arun) invocation by the OpenAI Agent runtime.
Message Receiving

Must wait for a corresponding response from the remote agent (with sensible timeouts).
Return that response text (or structured data) back to the calling chain.
Channel Management

Must open a channel (WebSocket) as needed, perform handshake, authenticate with Authed’s registry, optionally keep the channel open or close it after each request.
If a persistent channel is kept open, handle re-use across multiple calls in the same session.
Logging and Error Handling

Must handle connection issues or timeouts gracefully (e.g., raising descriptive exceptions or returning error strings).
Should integrate with any existing Authed message recording or logging system to provide transparency.
3.2 Out-of-Scope
Advanced Customization
The end-user should not need to handle advanced channel configurations. This tool is intended to be the high-level interface. Under-the-hood custom logic is possible, but not part of the standard usage path.
Multiple Targets in One Tool
The default approach is one AgentCommunicationTool instance per target agent ID. If a user wants multiple different targets, they can instantiate multiple tools.
4. Detailed Requirements
4.1 Usability & API
Single-Function Approach:
The user only calls something like my_tool.run({"message": "Hello!"}) or (under the hood) the OpenAI Agent calls _run() / _arun().
Minimal Imports:
The user’s code should only need to import one class from our package.
2–3 Lines Setup:
from my_distributed_sdk.tools import AgentCommunicationTool
tool_instance = AgentCommunicationTool("AGENT_B_ID")
Provide tool_instance in [tools=...] when initializing the agent.
4.2 Initialization & Configuration
Arguments:

target_agent_id (required) – an ID string for the remote agent.
registry_url (optional) – override default if not using environment variable / default.
agent_id, agent_secret (optional) – if not found in environment, provide a way to pass them in.
private_key, public_key (optional) – same as above, for cryptographic usage if needed.
Defaults:

If environment variables exist for AGENT_ID, AGENT_SECRET, etc., the tool automatically picks them up.
4.3 Internal Operation
Channel Handling:

Open or Reuse WebSocket channel:
Use ChannelAgent.open_channel with the specified target_agent_id.
Send a message in the correct format:
e.g. MessageType.REQUEST with content_data.
Wait for response up to a default timeout (configurable, e.g., 5 seconds).
Close or keep open (depending on ephemeral or persistent design).
Error & Timeout Handling:

Must raise or return a descriptive error if the channel can’t be opened or if a response is not received in time.
Provide meaningful debug logs.
4.4 Security & Validation
Authentication:
Must authenticate with Authed’s registry for channel opening if required.
Encryption / Signing:
If private_key & public_key are provided, sign messages or handle encryption as the Authed protocol specifies.
4.5 Tool Interface
Name & Description:
name = "agent_communication"
description = "Sends messages to a remote agent via Authed protocol and returns responses."
Argument Schema:
message: str (required)
Additional optional fields as needed (priority, subject, etc.).
4.6 Performance
Latency:
Should handle message send + receive within a typical sub-second range for local or minimal-latency networks.
The default timeout might be 5s or 10s to accommodate slower networks or if remote agent is busy.
Scalability:
The basic usage scenario is single request/response at a time. If advanced concurrency or streaming is needed, we can expand the tool, but that is not the minimal use case.
4.7 Diagnostics & Logging
Provide a straightforward debug mode (e.g., environment variable or constructor param) to show detailed logs or to record all WebSocket messages into .json logs.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Reliability
The tool should gracefully handle typical network errors, logging them and returning safe error messages to the user.
Maintainability
Code must be modular, with the low-level Authed logic in the underlying ChannelAgent so the tool remains a thin wrapper.
Compatibility
Must be compatible with the standard OpenAI Agents or openai tool architecture.
Should work in Python 3.8+ (or whichever versions the OpenAI Agents SDK supports).
Security
Must not expose secrets in logs.
Should handle private key usage carefully, e.g., not storing in plain text beyond environment or ephemeral usage.
6. User Flows
6.1 Minimal Flow
Developer installs my_distributed_sdk (which includes AgentCommunicationTool).
Developer has environment variables set for AGENT_ID, AGENT_SECRET, etc.
Developer writes:
python
Copy
Edit
from openai import Agent
from my_distributed_sdk.tools import AgentCommunicationTool

comm_tool = AgentCommunicationTool("AGENT_B_ID")
agent = Agent(tools=[comm_tool])
When the agent needs to contact AGENT_B:
The agent calls comm_tool._run(message="Hello!") internally.
_run uses the Authed ChannelAgent to open the channel, send, receive, close, returns the response.
The agent sees the returned text and continues its chain-of-thought.
6.2 Error Handling Example
If remote agent is unreachable, _run returns an error string or raises an exception:

The developer sees a log: “Failed to open channel: Connection refused.”
The agent can handle or re-try, depending on the conversation context.
7. Implementation Plan
7.1 Milestones
Prototype
Implement AgentCommunicationTool class with the minimal _run logic that logs or prints messages (mocking out real WebSocket calls).
Integration with Authed
Replace mock calls with real ChannelAgent usage:
open_channel
send_message
receive_message
close_channel
Add environment variable support for keys/IDs.
Test & Validate
Write integration tests using an actual local “Agent B” or test harness.
Ensure synchronous and asynchronous calls work in a standard OpenAI Agent environment.
Logging & Error Handling
Confirm robust logs, error messages, timeouts, and partial-failure scenarios.
Documentation
Provide minimal usage instructions (the 2–3 lines).
Provide advanced usage instructions for customizing or passing additional fields.
8. Testing & QA
Unit Tests:
Basic tests verifying _run and _arun handle normal requests, timeouts, and errors.
Integration Tests:
Spin up a local or mock remote agent (like your existing agent_b.py) to confirm message exchange.
Regression Tests:
Keep existing test scripts (test_run.py) that spawn two local agents and ensure the new tool can also talk to them.
Performance Tests:
For typical usage (1–5 messages), ensure minimal overhead and minimal latencies.
9. Risks & Mitigations
Network Unavailability
Provide clear error messages or fallback logic.
Key/Secret Misconfiguration
Gracefully fail if no environment variables or credentials are found, with instructions to set them.
Tool Incompatibility
Thoroughly test with the official OpenAI Agents library. Confirm that the tool’s _run/_arun signatures match expected patterns.
10. Documentation & Final Delivery
Deliverables:

AgentCommunicationTool class as part of my_distributed_sdk/tools.py.
Example usage code snippet showing the 2–3-line integration.
Automated test suite verifying local message exchange end-to-end.
Documentation:

Clear README or docstring specifying environment variable usage, how to pass credentials, and advanced features.
“Troubleshooting” section for common errors (e.g., connection refused, missing agent ID).
Conclusion
This PRD mandates a fully functioning but extremely easy to integrate tool for OpenAI Agent developers. By encapsulating all Authed functionality (secure channel creation, message handling, optional encryption, logging, error handling), the AgentCommunicationTool will let developers connect their AI agents to other services or agents with only a few lines of Python.
