# Integrating Authed with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

This document outlines a plan to integrate Authed, an identity and authentication system for AI agents, with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol for connecting AI models with external data sources and tools. The integration will allow Authed to serve as the authentication layer for MCP servers and clients.

## Background

### Authed
- Provides unique identities for AI agents
- Enables secure agent-to-agent authentication
- Uses cryptographic signatures for verification
- Manages agent permissions and access control

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Standardizes connections between AI models and external data/tools
- Enables AI assistants to access contextual information
- Currently lacks a standardized authentication mechanism
- Supports custom authentication strategies

## Integration Approach

The integration will follow these key principles:

1. **Non-invasive**: Implement MCP authentication without significant changes to either system
2. **Standards-based**: Follow OAuth 2.1 principles where applicable
3. **Agent-centric**: Leverage Authed's agent identity system
4. **Secure by design**: Maintain cryptographic verification throughout

## Technical Implementation

### 1. MCP Server Authentication Adapter

Create an adapter that sits between MCP servers and clients to handle authentication:

```python
class AuthedMCPServerAdapter:
    def __init__(self, mcp_server, authed_client):
        self.mcp_server = mcp_server
        self.authed = authed_client
        
    async def handle_request(self, request):
        # Verify Authed authentication
        auth_header = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not auth_header or not auth_header.startswith("Bearer "):
            return {"error": "Authentication required"}
            
        token = auth_header.replace("Bearer ", "")
        agent_id = await self.authed.verify_token(token)
        
        if not agent_id:
            return {"error": "Invalid authentication"}
            
        # Add agent_id to request context
        request.context["agent_id"] = agent_id
        
        # Forward to MCP server
        return await self.mcp_server.handle_request(request)
```

### 2. MCP Client Authentication Adapter

Create an adapter for MCP clients to obtain and use Authed tokens:

```python
class AuthedMCPClientAdapter:
    def __init__(self, mcp_client, authed_client):
        self.mcp_client = mcp_client
        self.authed = authed_client
        
    async def prepare_request(self, request, target_server_id):
        # Get token for target server
        token = await self.authed.get_interaction_token(target_server_id)
        
        # Add token to request headers
        if "headers" not in request:
            request["headers"] = {}
        request["headers"]["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {token}"
        
        return request
        
    async def send_request(self, request, target_server_id):
        # Prepare request with authentication
        authenticated_request = await self.prepare_request(request, target_server_id)
        
        # Send to MCP server
        return await self.mcp_client.send_request(authenticated_request)
```

### 3. MCP Server Registration with Authed

Register MCP servers as agents in the Authed system:

```python
async def register_mcp_server(authed_client, server_name, server_description):
    # Generate key pair for server
    private_key, public_key = authed_client.generate_key_pair()
    
    # Register server as an agent
    server_agent = await authed_client.register_agent(
        name=server_name,
        description=server_description,
        public_key=public_key
    )
    
    return {
        "agent_id": server_agent.id,
        "private_key": private_key,
        "public_key": public_key
    }
```

### 4. Permission Management

Implement permission management for MCP servers and clients:

```python
async def grant_mcp_access(authed_client, client_agent_id, server_agent_id, permissions=None):
    # Default permissions for MCP access
    if permissions is None:
        permissions = ["read", "execute"]
        
    # Grant permissions
    await authed_client.grant_permission(
        source_agent_id=client_agent_id,
        target_agent_id=server_agent_id,
        permissions=permissions
    )
```

## Integration Flow

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Register MCP servers as agents in Authed
   - Configure MCP clients with Authed credentials
   - Set up permission relationships between clients and servers

2. **Runtime Flow**:
   - MCP client requests access to a server
   - Client obtains an interaction token from Authed
   - Client includes token in request to MCP server
   - Server verifies token with Authed
   - Server processes request if authentication is valid

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration
- Develop authentication adapters for MCP servers and clients
- Create registration utilities for MCP servers
- Implement basic permission management

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Add support for fine-grained permissions based on MCP operations
- Implement token caching and refresh mechanisms
- Create monitoring and logging capabilities

### Phase 3: Standardization
- Document the integration approach
- Propose extensions to MCP specification for standardized authentication
- Develop reference implementations for Python and TypeScript

## Security Considerations

- Ensure all communication uses TLS/HTTPS
- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Validate all cryptographic signatures
- Maintain audit logs of authentication events
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Conclusion

This integration will provide a secure, scalable authentication layer for MCP, leveraging Authed's agent identity system. By following this plan, we can enable authenticated access to MCP servers while maintaining the flexibility and extensibility of both systems.
